	<p class="mb-4 text-stone-300">
		Tailwind Typer is a typing game that helps you learn the Tailwind CSS utility classes. As you
		type the classes, the element on the screen will change to reflect the classes you've typed. The
		goal is to type the classes as quickly and accurately as possible. Tailwind Typer can help you
		improve your typing speed and accuracy when working with Tailwind CSS, and it can help you
		memorize the framework's utility classes.
